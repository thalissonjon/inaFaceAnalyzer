"dest_ass" (non mantatory) is a path used to export results to ASS rich subtitles (displayed in VLC or ELAN).
"dest_mp4" (non mandatory) is a path used to export results to MP4 video

Smoothed classification estimates are associated to "_avg" suffix in resulting column names,
and are more robust than frame-isolated predictions.
"videokeyframes" restrict analyses to video key frames. It allows the fastest
video analysis sumary, but is is associated to a non uniform frame sampling rate.
